This project aims to improve preparedness and response to natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods in Morocco, by developing an interactive web application. This application allows users to report disasters in real time and access an interactive map of safe and at-risk areas. Users can also create accounts to receive real-time alerts and preparation tips. This innovative technological solution facilitates the coordination of relief efforts and informed decision-making, helping to minimize loss of life and property damage.
